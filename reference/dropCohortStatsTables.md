# Drop cohort statistics tables

This function drops the cohort statistics tables.

## Usage

``` r
dropCohortStatsTables(
  connectionDetails = NULL,
  connection = NULL,
  cohortDatabaseSchema,
  cohortTableNames = getCohortTableNames(),
  dropCohortTable = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- connectionDetails:

  An object of type `connectionDetails` as created using the
  [`createConnectionDetails`](https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/createConnectionDetails.html)
  function in the DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if
  `connection` is provided.

- connection:

  An object of type `connection` as created using the
  [`connect`](https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/connect.html)
  function in the DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if
  `connectionDetails` is provided, in which case a new connection will
  be opened at the start of the function, and closed when the function
  finishes.

- cohortDatabaseSchema:

  Schema name where your cohort tables reside. Note that for SQL Server,
  this should include both the database and schema name, for example
  'scratch.dbo'.

- cohortTableNames:

  The names of the cohort tables. See
  [`getCohortTableNames`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortGenerator/reference/getCohortTableNames.md)
  for more details.

  Optionally drop cohort table in addition to stats tables (defaults to
  FALSE)
